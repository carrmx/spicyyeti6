				<h1>how to commit suicide</h1>
				<p>wait why did i encase this entire fucking thing in a single p tag. mamma mia... the internet will always be there for you http://www.depressed.net/suicide/suicidefaq/index.html i went through the fucking library of alexandria of perscriptions in my drawer and i couldnt find ANYTHING listed on the site. so depressing. at least this website has some funny things
				<img src="../img/why so orange.PNG">
				"Probably, the only way to kill yourself with this stuff is to drop two tonnes of it on yourself." HGHKGHKHJK
				<br>as opposed to the poisons page the "other methods" page is basically a ton of goofs. give it a look, unless youre trying to kill yourself. someone trying to kill themselves shouldnt be reading what someone else who is trying to kill themselves is writing. get the hell out of here!
				<br>minor tangent. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_methods
				<br>so its listing listing listing all these run of the mill suicide methods and such and all of a sudden
				<img src="../img/VOLCANO.PNG">
				Volcano
				<br>
				<br>
				<br>i was intrigued by what else could be on depressed.net. im tired of living but im still interested in websites. kinda weird to see sex and death contained in the same archive as the only topics here but i guess it makes sense. actually the other day i watched boogie nights and ended up going on this huge expedition for early animated porn AHDKAHKJG I HAVE ALL MY TANGENTS LAID OUT FOR A POST BUT ID LIKE TO HUNT DOWN SOME OF THE LOST MEDIA FIRST. in the meantime check this out...for my sake... https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Eveready_Harton_in_Buried_Treasure.ogv
				(ALSO WTF IS AN .OGV)
				<br><br>
				<img src="../img/geek porn.gif">
				<br>through this page http://depravity.depressed.net/ i found 
				Annabelle's Dungeon of Depravity.
				<img src="../img/dungeon.PNG">
				FDASFKSHADK SHE ACTS REALLY LIKE "ENTER AT YOUR OWN RISK" BUT THE LATE 90S VIBE JUST MAKES IT COME OFF AS WHOLESOME. EVEN THOUGH SHE WROTE SANTA RAPEFIC AHGJHDSAKJHSKFHDKSJHFKJDHJ im serious WHY GIVE ME THE HARD SELL ON THIS DSAHSGHDKSGHKJS
				<img src="../img/everybody.PNG">
				<i>EVERYBODY LOVES THIS STORY.</i> HJHJDGHJGGGDHJGDHFSDHJF its like her fantasy santas entire entourage of elves and reindeer and shit *************** her while santa watches with BLOODSHOT EYES. AND AT THE END SHES LIKE. ALL I WANTED WAS FOR SANTA TO *********** ME FDSHAKFHSDAFKJHSADJKF IM NOW SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING THAT SANTA FETISHES ARE REAL THINGS PEOPLE DEVELOP. I TOLD YOU NOT TO LET YOUR KIDS SIT ON THAT DIRTY MANS LAP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
				<img src="../img/reindeer games.PNG">
				<br>depravity will lead to http://www.janesguide.com/ which doesnt actually seem all that depraved at all. this ladys icon is so super cute
				<img src="../img/jane.PNG">
				my screenshots are coming out 999% oranger than my screen its pissing me off. PISSING ME OFF I TELL YOU. her website doesnt seem to want to load whatsoever...easier to access through wayback. and for a sex website it looks so business casual right HASKHGKDS annabelle had the right idea tricking her shit out like
				<img src="../img/the sickest sites.gif">
				I WANT THIS AWARD HOW DO I GET THIS. the sickest sites just had a bunch of hardcore porn on it though kinda boring ahiwjaghwakghaug the surge of power you feel clicking through those shady 90s porn sites knowing now that they cant hurt you. I once was a boy and now I'm a man.
				<br>only notable thing i plucked from janes site was this <a href="www.asacp.org">www.asacp.org</a> which has been operating on the net at least since 2005. according to jane its an organization that investigates child porn on the internet and gets it taken down. WOW...IT HAD COMPLETELY ESCAPED ME THAT YOU COULD ACTUALLY GET CONTENT TAKEN OFF THE INTERNET BACK THEN. this website still appears functional, seems like a good thing to keep bookmarked.

			<br>there was a time when i was really On It with organizing my things. kept folders 
			concise with a strict file vetting process. 
			i was young, a fool with no concept of the true abundance in which information
			exists. you still think ORGANIZATION is REAL? Heh. You have quite the ways to go.
			soon youll realize that the only way to keep that shit under the lid will be to make
			several subfolders. it wont be long until the subsubfolders make their appearance and so on.
			at this rate, the folders will now practically outnumber the files themselves. you scramble to fit each folder
			with its own unqiue sorting system but victory is just out of your reach. now everytime you try sipping
			but a drop from the sea of folders, shit takes like a full minute to load up--because theres
			STILL too many files in it to sort efficiently i guess? you act on the only instinct that's
			ever done you any good. you make more folders. to help share the load, right? <b>no. it's too late.</b>
			congrats, you're stuck with twice the number of many shitty folders that wont load.
			the rotting corpse of a once utopian civilization where anarchy now 
			reigns whispers to you, influences you to make a metaphor inside of a metaphor
			about how bad the folder situation has gotten.
			you've completely lost your way. in the sea. of information. 
			<br>youll never see your family again.

			ive been so into parappa the rappa lately!!! and um jammer lammy too DUH. i might

			dkas;dkas;ld so i came across this hilarious PSA album https://youtu.be/3iyi1bk0Bvo
			<img src="https://otaku.com/files/images/fullsize/79269D2.JPG">
			you know what else is hilarious the site hosting this image is called otaku.com like
			damn you gotta be a straight playa to own otaku.com no funny stuff in the url or nothin.
			lets not get distracted for the love of god. seriously what was i even talking about
			a few seconds ago YES the psa album. OMG ITS SO FUNNY i would reccommend you NOT
			be introduced to parappa through these means because this album contradicts
			the absurdist/No-Flips-Given attitude of the actual games. BUT IF YOU WANT TO HEAR
			PARAPPA LEGIT SAY "STAY AWAY FROM DRUGS" AND RAPONDER THE MYSTERY OF
			CHILDBIRTH THEN THIS IS THE ALBUM FOR YOU!!!! its funny enough in the game how
			parappa has that half-kid half-adult thing goin' on like spongebob. hes living with his dad
			and goin to karate lessons with kids then suddenly hes getting his drivers license 
			and pulling up to his girlfriends house in his new car. huh? okay. same i guess.

			<br>https://www.bgreco.net/misc
			<br>found this site readin homestuck cuz i was illegally readin hussies commentary (dont tell
			him that, he'll divorce me) through a Certain Extension. that extension occasionally included
			links to versions of the flashes that had different songs.
			i guess some bolin guy used to make the music for homestuck, but Drama Transpired and 
			his music was replaced with the stuff we know and love today. what a tragedy...?
			those flashes were hosted on this bgreco site. this greco has got quite a lot of cool stuff here.
			came for the homestuck, stayed for the objection page,
			the rainbow bookmarklet, and the error pages. https://www.bgreco.net/forbidden/forbidden.htm

			i happen to be listening to techno music right now. just TRY and tell me there isnt a god.

			<br>OH. MY. FREAKING. GOSH. youtube has trapped me in an endless spiral of japanese electronic music for god knows how long now.
			at first autoplay just kept giving me plastic love, which just became simply unacceptable. it mustve started from well idk plastic love is just
			a universal experience on youtube KFJLDF but i did listen to a bunch of lofi compilations which for some reason are always anime themed.
			oh wait you know i just remembered something my first lofi compilation was that samurai shampoo one i watched right after finishing the anime.
			anyways, 
			and so began my inescapable descent into japanese electronic music. spoilers: if anything ive learned from my imprisonment THAT JAPANESE ELECTRONIC MUSIC IS THE BEST.
			
			<br>I'VE NO MEMORY OF WHERE IT TRULY BEGAN (EVEN THOUGH I KINDA DO)... BUT IT ALWAYS COMES BACK TO <i>SPORTSMEN</i>. ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cqdv032mFbg&ab_channel=oaoii )

			without much regard to where this music came from, i happily accepted it into my favorites. of course i would come to realize that 
			this little beauty was by Hosono The Great, the bassist of YMO. i don't want to get too ahead of myself but there is a very 
			important YMO-related video i need to <b>immediately</b> relate to sportsmen:

				to find out about yukihiro takahashi's sportsmen cover holy SHIT. this is so good...its the perfect soothing counterpoint
				to <span style="background: black;" title="SPOILERS">the kimono's</span> heavier more BOOMBOOMBOOM version. of course hisono's original version sits in the middle its like
				the base from which the pendulum swings or whatever KFHDKSJGHDSAJKGH can someone tell me what is up with this
				video oh well its pretty soothing in itself albeit creepy and sperm looking. 
				<br><br>OH YEAH I FORGOT TO MENTION WHY IM INSERTING THIS HERE
				WELL I SUPPOSE ITS OBVIOUS BUT I JUST THINK ITS FUNNY I WAS LIKE ACCUSING TAKAHASHI OF NOT KNOWING THE LYRICS WHEN LASKDFHDKASGHSDKJHFDSKJFGSD
				YEAH HE OBVIOUSLY KNOWS THE LYRICS. OR HE KNEW THEM AND FORGOT THEM. OR HE WAS SO SHAMED BY THAT COUNTRY PERFORMANCE
				THAT HE SET OUT TO MEMORIZE THE LYRICS VERY WELL AND CREATED HIS OWN SPORTSMEN COVER TO MAKE UP FOR IT.
				<br><br>speaking of takahashi i was feverishly searching for his Once A Fool album (why does he shade himself
				so much with those album names??? Once A Fool. The Dearest Fool. TAKAHASHI IM CERTAIN YOU'RE A GENIUS YOU WERE IN YMO 
				ALSO KNOWN AS THE GENIUS BAND WTF)
				and found this nifty little resource pertaining to his disography

			<br> OKAY AND YOU KNOW WHAT SPEAKING OF HOSONO BEING SILLY AF i think that chow chow dog ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-2zlV8YXxM&ab_channel=YMOUnofficial )
			is where i officially soul bonded with him forever. you need to listen at least long enough to hear him doing the pseudo dog yarping noises. oh my god yes?

			<br>sorry Hosono The Great but you just got OWNED. THIS VERSION ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! TAKE NOTE OF Leo Imai The Hot'S UNRIVALED HOT VOICE.
			<b>YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</b> sportsmen was what first brought me to the kimonos (here's my fav song of theirs 
			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycRvcVdlxIY&ab_channel=matsuristudio the vid is cool too), 
			<img src="../img/coolthing_almost.PNG">
			<br> but it was not my first exposure to Imai The Hot.
			
			<br><br>my first encounter with leo was a product of my towa tei adventure. AHEM. allow me to back the fuck up and properly introduce 
			Tei The Divine. i'm sure at least 2 out of the 3 of you here know what groove is in the heart is so im not even going to bother linking it.
			it's awesome but it doesn't really belong among the ranks of these epic links. anyways that song was produced by towa tei--but a droplet in the
			lake of flawless music his name is attached to. my absolute TOTAL AND FINAL FAVORITE SONG SINCE HANSEN 108 BY SUSUMU HIRASAWA (WHICH WILL PROBABLY ALWAYS BE
			MY NUMBER ONE LETS NOT LIE I MEAN these celestial beings dont even hold a candle or whatever the saying is to Lord Hirasawa Destroyer Of Lesser Musicians)
			<br> LUV U TOKIO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6D4REZZtOOk&ab_channel=WarnerMusicJapan		
			<img src="../img/coolthings_luv.PNG">
			<br> ENDLESS REPLAY VALUE. IT NEVER ENDS. I NEVER GET SICK OF HEARING IT. I NEVER GET SICK OF WATCHING THE VIDEO. IT'S BEAUTIOUS. THIS SONG WAS MADE 
			FOR ME AND ME FOR IT. 
			<br>NOW THIS IS WHERE THINGS BECOME REALLY INTERESTING. FIRST OF ALL: LEO. 
			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LBUEYGfisQ&ab_channel=WarnerMusicJapan
			<img src="../img/coolthing_hot.PNG">
			experience leo's stage presence here. i never seen a musical performer purposefully look straight into the camera like that fjlkdsafdjsa
			he certainly got my attention. also i wonder if that mannequin is a reference to kraftwerk. i ALSO wonder...<i>something else.</i>
			there appears to be something VERY IMPORTANT missing from this video. someone. someone very important. 
			wait no he's right there DSAKD;SLAKF THAT STUPID MICROPHONE IS JUST BLOCKING HIS FACE
			<img src="../img/coolthing_micro.PNG">
			<br>IT'S YUKIHIRO THE WISE!!!! YES, IT IS THE MAN WE MET IN ACT 1. HE HAS REAPPEARED AND THIS TIME HE IS PROPERLY EQUIPPED.
			IT'S NO WONDER METAFIVE IS SO EFFING GOOD. WE HAVE LEO THE HOT, TEI THE DIVINE, AND YUKIHIRO THE WISE (AND SOME OTHER
			PROBABLY EQUALLY AMAZING GUYS WHO I HAVENTED INVESTIGATED YET) ALL FUSED? WTF YES! THANKS! I LOVE THIS DEVELOPMENT! idk if metafive is still
			together but in tei's 2017 album im pretty sure all the same people were present. 
			<br> now i know wat ur thinking..............."carmi its 3am and u have class tomorrow, and also, carmi, as a continuation of my thought,
			what makes yukihiro so wise anyways??? all he did was shake that egg :\" ummm well let me prove to ya his excellence. tomorrow. to be continued! 
			
			<br><br>WAIT! IT'S CARMI FROM THE FUTURE. REMEMBER HOW I WAS JUST ABOUT TO PROVE YUKIHIROS WISDOM?
			WELL, I'M STILL GOING TO DO THAT. BUT ALLOW ME TO DO IT BEFORE I GET TO IT.
			<br>YUKIHIRO -> OSOMATSU!?!?@!$!@$#@!?!?@#!#!@!? ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-i_0o7vx8pw&ab_channel=MariSama )

				credit to BLADE for this illustration (i dont know who that is or if they are a tangible entity.)
				idk, did i get your attention with this anime <span style="background:black;" title="SPOILERS" >YMO</span> cover AKGHAKJGHKJ basically yesterday i found a METAFIVE version of kimi ni mune kyun 
				<small>
				(youll find this version in my playlist of copious amounts of kimi ni mune kyun renditions which i suppose i am officially linking
				not in unnoticable tiny text but in big important text NOW
				</small>
				<h1>https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcGic-n8EVRL1hxJfASnpNnkPK8HrxrZ1 )</h1>
				which at the time i did not know the name of because I Dont Speak Japanese. Not Speaking Japanese, i linked it in my group chat asking
				some of the Japanese Speaking to help me find a studio version.
				<img src="../img/coolthings_bob.jpg">
				yeah so nobody replied and i just put the title in google translate. i couldnt find a better quality version of the  METAFIVE version :,(
				but youtube was absolutely STACKED with covers of this song. initially i tried ordering the playlist in order of quality...THAT STUPID
				ANIME VERSION KEPT CLIMBING ABOVE EVERYTHING GKJAGHAJK IT EVEN SUPERCEDED METAFIVE BECAUSE ITS SO ON CRACK. IN THE END
				I ORDERED THE PLAYLIST MORE LIKE THIS (insteadofdoingmyworkatwork)...
				<br><br>
				ORIGINAL -> INTERESTING -> GOOD -> ORIGINAL...With a twist! -> INTERESTING -> GOOD -> ORIGINAL (WITH FUNNY VIDEO MUST WATCH UNTIL END) -> INTERESTING -> GOOD
				<br><br>
				1. ORIGINAL
				<img title="SPOILERS" src="../img/coolthing_YMO.PNG">
				this graphic kill't me dead.....................uhm cute? oh yeah something funny about this song in general is that
				it sounds like they accidentally start it too early with that first "kyu--" AHJKFDSAHFKJDSAHF LIKE THEY CUT THEMSELVES OFF
				BUT THATS 100% INTENTIONALLY BUILT INTO THE SONG AHKAJTEJKAKJGAHJKGSAD THAT'S SO <span style="background:black;" title="SPOILERS" >YMO</span> 
				this is foreshadowing of their great power.
				<br>
				<br>
				2. INTERESTING
				<br>ive already got my hysteria over this one all out havent i HDKJSGHDSAJK but it leads me on a bit of another tangent...
				<div class="sportsman" style="background: #ff9eb1;">
					there is this other band yukihiro was in called THA MOONRIDERS (nah it was just "The" moonriders). (or wait. is it just MOONRIDERS? is it
					like the gorillaz, which has no "the" at all? O_O this will haunt me...)
					UM WELL FIRST OF ALL THE ALBUM YUKIHIRO WAS INVOLVED IN <a href="https://youtu.be/--7AG5UN9G4"> "DONT TRUST OVER THIRTY" </a> 
					(but this is a whole album like put this away and listen to it when youre done listening to me talk)
					IS LIKE LEGIT MY FAV ALBUM EVER NOW OKAY I FOUND IT PUT IT IN MY FAVS AND LISTENED TO IT LIKE 20 TIMES IN A ROW
					THE MOMENT IT GRACED MY LIFE STOP omg wait i have to download it HOLDON. IM GOing to put it in my music archive that doesnt exist.
					<br><br>actually i think yukihiro joined MOONRIDERS in his duo, THE BEATNIKS. i forget why/how i know this but check out this
					Killer Song they did ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NbRyV6vmixw&ab_channel=MrYt666 ) 
					<img src="../img/coolthing_beatniks.PNG">
					i aint gon lie they look fly and i love this set AKJGHA I QUITE RACISTLY ASSUMED THE OTHER GUY WAS HOSONO BUT NO...NO THATS JUST...
					SOME OTHER LEGENDARILY TALENTED MUSICIAN. i know one day ill be back here cursing my name for disregarding him when i turn into his
					megafan.
					<br>anyways with the moonriders they did this song about a jellyfish or something and i swear to god this is among
					the best songs ive ever heard JKSDAGJKDSAHGJKSAGH YOU KNOW WHEN U HEAR A SONG AND U JUST KNOW...INSTANTLY...
					I FEEL LIKE IM ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT THE BEST THIS THE BEST THAT AND QUITE FRANKLY IM VERY PROUD OF MYSELF FOR 
					JOINING THE WORLD'S BEST THINGS HERE TOGETHER ON THIS EVERLASTING DIGITAL DAY. OH RIGHT LET ME LINK THE SONG
					<h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OCqTJiC5pU&list=PLcGic-n8EVRKrEy0frLd4wEot7bzjHSnw&index=2&t=0s&ab_channel=sandalhui">
					https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLcGic-n8EVRKrEy0frLd4wEot7bzjHSnw
					</a></h2>
					i use big but not as big as last time since we're in a subsection text because im linking another playlist containing
					multiple versions of the same song but not quite as many. still theyre both GOOD and INTERESTING covers. i dont know
					where they came from, i dont know where they go, i dont know where they cotton eyed joe. dude i screwed up the
					title of this playlist so bad HFDSAGHSADK I DIDNT EVEN KNOW THE TRANSLATION OF THE TITLE UNTIL TODAY.
					I MESSED UP BY NOT INCLUDING THE 9, WHICH SOMEHOW TRANSLATES TO SEPTEMBER (WELL THE "SOMEHOW" IS A BIT OBVIOUS ISNT IT),
					WHICH I THOUGHT WAS TRACK NUMBER. DOI!!!!!!!!!!!!! oh man you know how else this relates
					is that both of these covers are apparently sung by anime girls AGHAKJG okay heres a stock image of a jellyfish
					<img src="../img/JELLYfish.jpg">
				</div>
				<br>
				3. GOOD
				<img src="../img/coolthing_weekendshuffle.PNG">
				wat kan i say jazz makes everything cool
				<br>
				<br>
				5. INTERESTING 
				yeah im skipping stuff now when i said "what can i say" i really meant i was running out of things to say.
				<img src="../img/coolthing_humanleague.PNG">
				<img src="../img/coolthing_english.PNG">
				jkashgjasAHGJKAS YEAH I MEAN OUT OF THE TWO ENGLISH SPEAKING COVERS IN THIS PLAYLIST THIS IS DEFINITELY THE GOOFIER ONE.
				BUT. *BUT!* YUKIHIRO SINGS IN A LOT OF ENGLISH AND HIS IS LIKE EQUALLY BAD?? AGAKJSHGJKA its a fair trade.
				whatever this The Human League thing is i feel like i'd like it. it reminds me of the kimonos version of sportsmen
				which really...I DONT KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE MUSIC. HARDENS THE MUSIC? MAKES IT SOUND MORE...SQUARE...ROBOTIC? like it has
				precisely uniform edges. i like music like that. its weird kraftwork is more that than <span style="background:black;" title="SPOILERS">YMO</span> but i dont like kraftwork at all??? hasdjkgas
				maybe the hard music has to be a derivative of either more organic or poppy/light music. 
				i've reminded myself of this song <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5QErPDNcj4&ab_channel=aritnem434343"> 'warm leatherette' </a> which is the square sounding kraftworky stuff 
				im talking about. and Honestly? Can I be honest? i cant see how this song has any organic/poppy twist at all FDSAJKFHSD BUT I ABSOLUTELY
				LOVE IT...THE MADDENING REPETITION...FEELS LIKE MY ENAMEL IS MELTING OUT OF MY EARS...
				YOU KNOW THATS MY STUFF...DUDE THIS HAS JUST BECOME AN EXISTENTIAL CRY TO THE GODS
				ASKING WHY I DON'T LIKE KRAFTWORK YET JAGKAHGKJASGHK Well...I Guess We'll Just Never Know.
				<br>
				<br>
				7. ORIGINAL
				<br>this video is so funny please... my friend neil told me to watch some of <span style="background:black;" title="SPOILERS">YMO's</span> videos and it took me THIS LONG?!!?
				LOOK THEYRE EVEN MAKING FUN OF THAT EARLY START AHGKJAGHKS OR REALLY HIGHLIGHTING IT TO THE POINT OF HILARITY. OKAY OKAY STOP
				we cant talk about these guys too much you dont even know who they are yet. we're going to cause a rift in the timeline stop!!!
				but look at hosono crab walking to steal your girl i mean come on...Come on...Ma Man...
				<br>
				<br>
				8. INTERESTING
				<br>my only question is what the hell is hastune miku orchestra
			</div>
			
			<br><br>...AIGHT LETS CONTINUE. 
			<br>when picking from material to display yukihiro's wisdom it becomes NATURAL INSTINCT to point to One. Special. Place.

			<br>together forever TT_TT so yeah yukihiro is the drummer and the singer. isnt his voice so smooth and good? YES OF COURSE IT IS DONT SPEAK.
			and so here we have Yukihiro The Wise, Sakamoto The Scholar, and of course, Hosono The Great.
			this is our chance to wrap back around to sportsmen, ending our journey in an elegant cycle. jk bitch theres still 
			tangents to be had.
			
			<br><br>YMO -> DENKI GROOVE. 
			<br>FOUND DENKI THROUGH A COVER THEY DID OF YMO( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEKqLWs-FuA )
			<br>dude denki groove is one of those bands that matches my everything ;KD;SAKDK; they came later than YMO so they have that punk ass 90's charm
			I'M HONESTLY SHOCKED AND APPALLED THAT THEIR MUSIC WASN'T FEATURED IN JET SET RADIO. THEIR MUSIC IS MORE JET SET RADIO THAN JET SET RADIO. LISTEN TOTHIS
			https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DgSZKBavEKE&t=0s&index=58&list=FLnRr9ofB5bHxADJlB7vUS2w 
			<br>here is my favorite denki groove song being "Played" live https://youtu.be/J63xQfC0pYM
			um first of all ;LSAKD;LAJLDSAJFDSLA; OKAY THERS SO MANY CLASSIC ELEMENTS OF THIS VIDEO. THE GUY'S EYE-BLOCKING HAT STYLE IS MY EVERYTHING.

			LITTLE HAND DANCE THAT'S ME FOREVER NOW. ALSO IS THAT GUITAR........REAL????????????????????? DSAKHGABGJKGBJKNGJJK THERES NO

				yo. its carmi from the future again. hilarious news? one of the denki groove members
				is actually a character in the new yakuza game. its just another one of those cases
				where two pieces of media i love independent of each other turn out to have 
				incidental ties. Funny How That Works Out. but thats not the hilarious news.
				the hilarious news IS THAT THE DENKI GROOVE GUY WAS CAUGHT WITH COCAINE AND

				i dont know why this is so ridiculously funny to me??? i guess the fact that the yakuza franchise
				goes through all this effort to materialize REAL LIFE PEOPLE into the GAME WORLD im guessing in a

				that was not a sustainable fiction model in a world where we're learning to deconstruct our tendency towards

				RYUICHI -> CORNELIUS (I DIDNT KNOW WHERE TO PUT THIS BUT IT HAS RYUICHIS NAME IN IT SO I PUT IT UNDER THE PIC OF RYUICHI.)

				<br>CARMI FROM THE FUTURE HERE. I HAVE OFFICIALLY REALIZED THAT THIS DOCUMENT IS A MESS.
				i'm trying to do what karkat did in that elegantly written cyclical chatlog he had with his future self nearish the end of
				homestuck (ok im pretty sure this was pre game over lets not get ahead of ourselves). except in my version 
				theres nothing elegant or cyclical happening here its just a straight line that projects eternally Badways. 
				can i please stop talking now so i that i can show you this?
				<a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/1gxm_5cShUw"><img src="../img/coolthings_CORNELIUS APPEARS.png"></a>
				click it it goes to a much better place than here. in terms of the image itself im pretty sure the 
				contents of these annotated screenshots from like 3 weeks ago contain the genetic code for what this 
				post is meant to become. not sure if i can translate carvings this ancient but i can try. 
				BACK TO THE VIDEO. check out this guy.
				<img src="../img/coolthings not ryuichi.PNG">
				I SORT OF WONDERED LIKE 15% WONDERED IF THIS GUY COULD BE RYUICHI BUT ITS CLEAR HIS VIBE IS OFF.
				RYUICHI HAS VERY LIKE COOLMAN VIBES WHILE THIS DUDE HAS A PARTY SPIRIT. OKAY WAIT WHAT AM I DOING
				I HAVEN'T EVEN INTRODUCED CORNELIUS YET AHKFLADSHGKJLSADGKDSAHGKDSAGJKLDSAG HE'S HE MAIN GUY HERE.
				BECAUSE LIKE? WHEN I THOUGHT THIS MAN WHO CLEARLY IS NOT RYUICHI SAKAMOTO WAS RYUICHI SAKAMOTO 
				I SAW AN OPPORTUNITY TO PULL Cornelius Of The Sound Dimension INTO THIS POST. WHICH SO FAR, I HAVE DONE,
				ON THE PREMISE OF FAULTY EVIDENCE. BUT GET THIS AND YOU WILL NEVER BELIEVE THIS BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY AT THIS
				POINT THE NOTION OF PROMINENT JAPANESE MUSICIANS COLLABORATING WITH EACH OTHER IS COMPLETELY UNHEARD OF 
				TO YOU:
				<a title="CLICK ME IM NOT JOKING" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/myq75N6IXuE"><img src="../img/coolthings turnturn.PNG"></a>
				(click the image again.) (i'm trying out this new thing where i attach all links to images.)
				(because i feel like links that display as text make you go 'ew that looks boring i dont want to click that.')
				(if you believe or disbelieve my theory send your feedback to spicyyeti0@gmail.com.) ALSO ISNT IT CUTE THEY GOT TOGETHER
				TO DO THIS THING FOR HOSONO OR WHATEVER IS GOING ON HERE I DONT ACTUALLY KNOW WHATS GOING ON BUT HOSONOS THERE
				<br>so yeah. say hello to cornelius he is very good! my favorite song from him is this
				( https://youtu.be/Wr5f6hpYxmE ) (actually decided to abandon the link in image idea immediately.)
				(its kind of hard to tell what images are clickable on my website because of my simultaneously obtuse and avant garde

				jhafkj TJHSA THIS IMAGE ISNT GOOD BUT I REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD WATCH THE VIDEO. YOU KNOW HOW 
				A REALLY GOOD MUSIC VIDEO CAN ADD A WHOLE NEW DIMENSION TO A SONG AND REALLY CAUSE IT TO IMPRESS ON YOU FOREVER?
				IMPRESS ON YOU is that how youd say that okay be quiet LOOK the image sucks because the animation is important to the video
				is important to the song so please PELASE cornelius has all sorts of cool Audio Visuals going on.
				I LOVE HOW THERES A VISUAL TO REPRESENT EVERY LAYER OF THE SONG!!! CORNELIUS HAS THAT SUPER PRODUCED REFINED 
				SOUND GOING ON THAT IS WHAT I LOVE THE MOST IN MUSIC. ITS ON <span title="SPOILER" style="background: white;">SUSUMU HIRASAWA</span> 
				AND METAFIVE LEVELS. oh man in this one song hes saying "TIMME AND SPAACEE AND MUUUUSSSICCCC" WHICH IS SO COOL BECAUSE
				MUSIC AND ANIMATION BOTH TRAVEL THROUGH TIME AND SPACE WITH AN EMPHASIS ON EITHER ELEMENT. I THINK PICTURE AND SOUND
				WERE REALLY MEANT TO GO TOGETHER!!!!!!!! speaking of space and time i was thinking about how the main kids in homestuck
				represent the elements of a narrative. time + space create the medium. light = image that populates space (your computer
				screen is Actually In Reality In Real Life projecting text and image through
				little lights or at least thats HOW IT WAS BACK IN MY DAY) and breath = 
				the force that moves the story (see again, light) through time. BREATH IS KIND OF LIKE YOU PRESSING THE ===> BUTTON TO 
				READ THE NEXT PAGE YAKNOW? DOES ANYBODY KNOW WHAT IM TALKING ABOUT YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAH i think you do.
				whats next. i think writing this blog gave me adhd or something is that bad to say. but if i go to a doctor
				and they tell me i have adhd then you cant say shhhhhhhhhhh to me AND IF I NEVER GO TO A DOCTOR TO FIND OUT
				WHETHER I HAVE IT OR NOT ITS THE COIN FLIP SUSPENDED IN THE AIR YOU KNOW IM WINNING SCHRODINGERS PARADOX. NOT EVEN
				GOING TO BOTHER CHECKING IF THATS HOW YOU SPELL HIS NAME BECAUSE WE HAVE PLACES TO BE BABY.
				<br>*POP* oh hey its carmi from a few minutes in the future. i want to show you this song.
				i just think it is a cool song that tells an interesting story. ( https://youtu.be/EtOjlJ76FHU ) 
				
				<br><br>CORNELIUS -> SUSHI -> FANTASTIC PLASTIC MACHINE -> TOWA TEI :O
				<img src="../img/coolthing sushi.PNG">
				OMG when i referred back to the diagram and saw cornelius->sushi I WAS SURE THAT I MESSED UP AND WAS JUST BEING RACIST AGAIN
				CONFUSING CORNELIUS FOR TOWA TEI. BECAUSE I KNEW TOWA TEI -> FPM -> SUSHI BUT BRO THE CHAIN IS EVEN STRONGER THAN THAT BRO
				BRO CAN YOU BELIEVE IT BRO ALKDJASLKDJSALKDJLK this is all genuinely exciting its like dendrites hooking up my brain but
				the dendrites are japanese people. i wonder if this post will ever expand from the japanese music scene? 
				there is no rule against that. i could relate kraftwerk to YMO but i dont really like kraftwerk JJKDAHG i could also
				use that one image to bring bowie into this even though idk wtf he was doing there. PAUSE.
				<br> UNPAUSE. oh yeah so anyways cornelius is clearly in sushi from tht screenshot i took.
				orri was very gracious to send me both sushis IN A COMPLETELY INNOCUOUS AND LEGAL MANNER JUST LIKE IN THE 
				80'S WHEN YOU WOULD HAND YOUR FRIEND TWO CDS ONE FOR SUSHI 3003 AND ONE FOR SUSHI 4004 AND IT WAS 
				LEGAL AND THE 80'S DONT YOU MISS THOSE DAYS???????????????????? DONT WORRY THESE DAYS REALLY ARENT DIFFERENT
				BECAUSE OUR ACTIONS ARE EQUALLY AS LEGAL NOW CAN YOU PLEASE BE QUIET. oh shit wait this song just came on i wanted to show before.
				im gonna go back into the past and put it where it belongs brb. *POP* *POP* im back. yeah i had to document that one
				because i always have trouble finding it?? I GOOGLE 'CORNELIUS THE SWEETEST CHILD' AND GET A BUNCH OF RANDOM SHIT.
				I HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT TITLE. THE SPELL OF A VANISHING LOVELINESS. THATS A REALLY COOL TITLE I LOVE IT IM GOING TO
				REMEMBER THAT FROM HERE ON OUT. what was i talking about what was i talking about what was i talking about i was talking about 
				SUSHI. 
				<br> SUSHI IS SUPER AWESOME THE WHOLE FUCKING THING IS JUST AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!! OMG!!!!!! I DONT KNOW
				*ANYHTING* ABOUT ITS ORIGINS BUT CHECK IT.
				SORRY IM TRYING TO NOT GO OFF INTO TANGENTS IN THIS SERIES OF TANGENTS CONTAINED IN ONE BIG TANGENT the tangent of life aha

				<br>GHIBLI -> RYUICHI SAKAMOTO -> HARUOMI HOSONO AGAIN 
				<br>you know i always thought that ryuichi sakamoto was a musician for studio ghibli. when 
				i originally wrote this post i tried linking him to ghibli but i saw 0.0% ghibli on his wikipedia and thought
				dang. i was Dead Wrong. turns out, i was DEAD RIGHT or wouldve been if i linked haruomi hosono to ghibli instead
				( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k7PQgfOhxmI ). 
				<img src = "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/A1Ioc5H3TWL._SY355_.jpg">
				stickers just linked me this and informed that hosono produced it. so what does it have to do with ryuichi?!?#!?#!@#!?@#!#!#?!
				Heh. ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_mvuDxs4Ot4&t=0s&index=462&list=FLnRr9ofB5bHxADJlB7vUS2w ) 
				<br> i had this cover in my playlist for a really long time

				RIGHT THERE FKLDJASFLKSAJFSAL STAY IN SCHOOL KIDS
				
				<br><br> HARUOMI HOSONO -> YUKIHIRO TAKAHASHI AGAIN

				and guess what hosono produced a cover of it ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=he-SBU362zE )
				KJFDSA I LOVE THE DESCRIPTION OF THIS VIDEO: "Synthetic Reggae bomb produced by Haruomi Hosono"
				oh my god hes got a bomb
				
				<br><br> HH -> AKIKO YANO
				<br>AAAAAAAAAAAAAAA THIS ONE IS GONNA BE HARD TO PUT TOGETHER BECAUSE THE LINKS ARE BURIED SO FAR
				DEEP IN MY (1894 VIDEO LONG (i wonder what people were doing in that year)) 
				PLAYLIST AND THE TITLES ARE IN JAPANESE HELP ME
				<br>OMG WAIT ;ASKD;LSA IM GLAD ALL OF THESE LINKS WERE SO HARD TO FIND BECAUSE I ENDED UP 
				FINDING SOMETHING REALLY GREAT THAT I DINDT KNOW EXISTED.
				<br> ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZWKfTP_ivl0 ) CHECK. THIS. SHIT. OUT! i was planning on 
				posting akikos live cover of this hosono song but omg...this is so good... KFLDAS OMG
				I JUST GOOGLE TRANSLATED THE DESCRIPTION 
				"Happy end and cover. The composer Haruomi Hosono was very pleased with this cover."
				BRO THATS CUTE AS EFF. WTF. IM OVER THE DANG MOON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
				lets back up the original incarnation of this song ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PfFEPtJE0D4 )
				was indeed by hosono i believe. just look at that face. whom else.
				<img src="../img/hosono.PNG">
				NOW the cover i was Originally going to link was this ( https://youtu.be/fsB6YImmhJA )
				its toned down in comparison to that not-live cover i just found, but watching
				akiko perform is just a freaking requirement. 
				<img src="../img/sheswatching.PNG">
				
				<br>AKIKO YANO -> KIYOSHIRO IMAWANO
				<br>allow me One Brief Tangent. a long time ago i found this crossover between
				akiko and a guy whose name i didnt know until now because i had to translate the characters
				of his name to search up his name but now i know that his name is indeed Kiyoshiro Imawano The Rock 'n' Rollening.
				i came across more of his music in a denki groove based auto generated youtube playlist yesterday did you know that.
				anyways listen to this ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVnY492917A )
				<br>could someone please tell me whose idea this video image was 
				<img src="../img/oh honey.PNG">
				Rock 'n' Roll.

				so. much. math homework. oh hey look better quality version of thsi performance ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9hKzwrRvE1w )
				
				<br>you know what on my journey i found this video of akiko playing with hosono in 2016 ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpsnyEYOAPY )
				;dsak;fdaskfasf it might not be that impressive to indirectly link their music if they're just
				WILLINGLY PLAYING TOGETHER ANYWAYS. KJFDFASJK LOOK THEYRE EXPLICITLY PLAYING HAPPY END TOGETHER. ALL MY WORK WAS FOR NOTHING?!!?!?!?

				IF THAT AINT ME. what about her F**************** VOCAL RANGE. HOLY CUTESY-SEXY-OPERATIC-PUNK-SCREAMO. AND THEN THERE'S HER PERFORMANCE
				AS THE CHARACTERS IN THIS VIDEO. her ability to portray these personas with her voice and acting

				<br>you would not believe how many break tags are on this page. theres definitely gotta be

			<br><h1>all these sexy romance kissing fucking flash games</h1>
			<br>*Takes a sip of wine.* Ah, hello. Didn't see you there. Please, take a seat, feel free to slip into something more comfortable for tonight's Cool Pages Page Post.
			<br>Ah, excuse me for one moment please. 
			<br>... alright im back. it took me about a month to actually return to this post after starting that intro. 
			and to top it all off, ive got like 4 posts sitting on top of this one that i havent written yet.
			prepare yourselves for the webpagening...
			<br><br> what was this one even OH YEAH IT WAS ABOUT SEXY ROMANCE KISSING FUCKIng games.
			i think it was a convo between me and stickers about these classic internet games that inspired me to make this post.
			dont be afraid, it starts off pure FJLAKF when i was little i always played on girlsgogames. that was my SHIT.
			i still return to play WHAT I CONSIDER A GENUINELY FUN GAME, which is the School Flirting Game (http://www.girlsgogames.com/game/school-flirting-game ).
			School Flirting Game is one of many variations. they're all literally the same game but they have cute recolors and CAN YOU BLAME THEM?
			FOR BEING CUTE? SO HERE'S THE GAME: YOU'RE COLLECTING A HAREM OF CUTE SCHOOLBOYS USING YOUR LASERBEAM HEARTS. OR I GUESS
			LASERBEAM EYES THAT EXTRACT HEARTS FROM INNOCENT MEN, RIPE FOR CONSUMPTION (BY YOU). AFTER YOU'VE LASERBEAMED A BOY HE BECOMES YOUR FAITHFUL
			AND TRUSTWORTHY MANSLAVE. THE AIM OF THE GAME IS TO COLLECT AS MANY MANSLAVES AS POSSIBLE!!! AND ONCE YOU'VE COLLECTED ENOUGH YOU BECOME THIS
			SUPERHUMAN HEART LASERBEAM GOD AK;ASDK;AS but even whilst in godmode the teacher can still beat your ass. she must have the most manslaves of all.
			this game is honestly so rewarding MODERN GAMES SHOULD BE TAKING NOTES HERE: the higher your score and the more Extra Hot Boys you enslave, the
			more extravagant your ending animation is!!! i dont think ive even unlocked all of them yet??? DUDE MY SCORE HERE SUCKS BECAUSE THE EFFING GAME WAS
			LAGGING BUT I PROMISE IT DOESN'T USUALLY LAG IT'S JUST BECAUSE I WAS TRYING TO PLAY AN MSI SONG IN THIS OTHER YOUTUBE TAB FLDSAJFLDSA
			<img src="../img/coolthings_manslaves.PNG">
			<br><h4>first time anyone has used a subheader in internet history</h2>
			<br>i have two more girlsgogames kissing game gems i must show you. did you know? in 2009 or whatever the heck i had to sneak
			behind my mom's back to access the Kissing Games section (YES THATS A REAL GENRE ON THIS WEBSITE) because whenever she caught me
			playing these games she would SCREAM. 
			<br>http://www.girlsgogames.com/game/kissmat-2
			<br>http://www.girlsgogames.com/game/kissing-during-work
			<br>the funny thing is the theme of these games are not getting caught by your boss or teacher.
			imagine little me trying to not get caught by my mom trying to not get caught by my teacher/boss kissing my virtual girlfriend. i have a few comments on these games. first of all i think kissmat is really clever in using the visuals to
			enhance the Pretty Much Not Even Gameplay. your ONLY goal is to watch the teacher, but once you start kissing all these awesome and distracting
			visuals appear. obviously your eyes latch onto the KISSING~!!`~~!!! but the students in the background are also very entertaining to watch fdkjlsaf
			i think it's cool how this game's difficulty is 100% reliant on interesting visuals. i am taking notes!!! and all i have to say about kissing during work
			is it's funny that when you get caught the man gets fired but the woman gets to keep her job JFKLDAS WHAT KIND OF GENDER BIASES WERE THESE GAMES
			INJECTING IN MY YOUNG IMPRESSIONABLE MIND? well, it's funny that you mention that, me...
			
			<br><h4>THE ORIGIN OF MY GENERATION'S ANTISOCIAL TENDENCIES</h4>
			<br>ALRIGHT BOYS *RUBS HANDS TOGETHER* THIS IS WHERE WE GET <b>NSFW</b>. NSFW is a lie i know this because
			my friend who has an Actual Real Life Job told me that she stumbles upon furry porn at least once a day on her work computer.
			i actually IMPLORE you to read this post at work and or school. i hope that youre a teacher so that you can do both at the same time!
			stickers linked me this 'Orgasm Girl' game from newgrounds (https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/180106 ). i mean already
			we've struck gold with that title. if i sound unfamiliar with this Absolute Classic its because i never actually played porn games as a kid
			;ad;saldks;adl i was too afraid of MOM'S IRON FIST. and beyond that i was scared to even see what naked people looked like. oh how far i've come.
			anyways, it's no wonder that this game is so jarring to current-me JLKSDAF I'M SEEING IT THROUGH THE LENS OF AN ADULT REFLECTING ON
			THE TYPE OF THING LITTLE KIDS WERE CONSUMING BACK THEN. IT'S ACTUALLY HORRIFYING ;AKD;ASDKAS;LKDA;F 
			<img src = "../img/coolthing_WAT1.png">
			YEP. THAT EXPLAINS A LOT. 
			<img src = "../img/coolthing_myTools.png">
			ALRIGHTY THEN I SEE YOU'VE BROUGHT YOUR RAPE ARSENAL AS WELL AS THE ENTIRE ESTABLISHMENT WITH YOU ON YOUR NOBLE QUEST. AND OF COURSE THIS STORE
			ONLY NEED BE STOCKED WITH 2 VITAL ITEMS. THE 2 ITEMS THAT DEFINED IT ALL. AH YES, HOW COULD I EVER FORGET? BRO WH FLASJLSAD;KSAF
			LITTLE KIDS WERE INTRODUCED TO SEX IN THIS CONTEXT. I FIGURED IT OUT GUYS. WE WERE DOOMED FROM THE START.
			<br>OH WELL. now that the mystery of the birthrate decline has been solved, let me show you some reasons why i can never stay mad at newgrounds:
			<img src="../img/coolthing_hentaihero.png">
			<br> this was the ad at the top of the page.
			<img src="../img/coolthing_myass.png">
			<br> and quite frankly, i couldn't have said it better myself.
			
			<br><h4>let us cleanse ourselves</h4>
			<br>here's another type of game i wouldve been playing as a kid. 
			<br>ELOUAI DRESSUP GAME (http://elouai.com/candybar5/dress-up-fullbodygirls.php ) !!! omg it has so many OPTIONS YOU COULD CREATE ENDLESS CASTS OF CHARACTERS IN THIS DUDE 
			ill always be crazy about dressup games. 
			i should make my own friggin dressup game i should have a page where you dress up the characters from my comics. 
			this website is all me acting on desires i had as a child KL;FDSA MY DESIRES REALLY HAVEN'T CHANGED SINCE THEN. 
			adult-me pretty much exists to serve child-me. my faithful servant. 
			<br><h4> why is this here</h4>
			<br>i left a bunch of links in here to remind myself to write about later.
			for some reason i left Kingdom of Loathing (https://www.kingdomofloathing.com ) (which for some reason suddenly gets a properly capitalized name unlike

			<br><h1>RANFREN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</h1>
			<br>HOLY CRAP i just learned thatmy favorite currently (i hope) running webcomic has a slamming website.
			im not sure how long it's been up but even if its only been up for 2 minutes im ASHAMED that i hadnt found it sooner.
			https://ranfren.neocities.org/main.html HERE IT IS!!!!!!! CLICK THAT LINK!!!!!!! PLEASE!!!!!!!!!! 
			<img src='https://ranfren.neocities.org/art/eyeball85.gif'>
			FIRST OF ALL. ive tried to restrain myself from talking about art or comics that i like on this page because shit would 
			simply get too out of hand. but this website gives me a unique opportunity (yes im shading every artist who doesnt have a
			slamming website) to go Absolutely Buck Wild. so here i go. these FUCKING COMICS ARE SO FUCKING GOOD. USUALLY WHEN I READ
			COMICS IM LIKE SNORE. ITS NOT EVEN MOVING BITCH. BUT GUESS WHAT. RANFREN IS SO ENTERTAINING THAT IT DOESNT HAVE TO MOVE,BECAUSEYOUKNOWWHAT?
			It will move <i> you</i>. To tears. from how good it is yeah idk KJFLDSA its like anime + canada = oh my god yes.
			OK BUT ALSO GUYS ALSO ALSO ALSOALSALSLASLSOOO LISTEN UP. I WANT YOU TO THOROUGHLY INSPECT THIS WEBSITE!!! i dont think ive even
			explored all the nooks and crannies yet. i got distracted by, oh, would you look at that, ranfrens very own cool pages page!
			https://ranfren.neocities.org/links.html im tempted to link all these things on my page but i dont have to because theyre right here.
			im just trusting that youll click it and then click all the links. all of them. if you werent prepared to click Every Link
			then why are you EVEN HERE. GET OUT. come back.omg but i will link my fav pages from this page.
			<br>https://gymkaki.com/threads/the-denko-saga-full-version.4671/ kjfdlsa its funny that this is here because just the other week me and my 
			friends were revisitng this TIMELESS CLASSIC.
			<br>https://www.cameronsworld.net/ i legit almost broke into tears this made me so sentimental IM NOT JOKING I DONT TELL JOKES
			<br>http://www.windows93.net/ reminder to me: revisit this and also the other sites here because i know you didnt even click all of the buttons you stinking goofball
			<br>http://www.mouchette.org/ i thought htis was really cool until i found out it was actually made by an Old Man. eff off but also still cool
			<br>JKFLDSA ALSO IM TOO SCARED TO CLICK THE SCARY LINKS LINKS. SOMEONE PLZ DO IT FOR ME OR HOLD MY HAND. i know whats behind that korean link and let me tell u,.,.,.,.,
			It Scared Me When I Was Twelve.
			<br><h1>i like doors</h1>
			http://www.appearingtogothrough.com/
			<br> found this from http://www.boxofchocolates.nl/ who apparently made the "Kick Buttowski" flash game for disney JKLFDAS
			I WAS LOOKING AT SOME OF HIS OTHER PROJECTS AND THINKING THIS GUY DEFINITELY MADE FLASH GAMES FOR CARTOON NETWORKS(NOT NECESSARILY CARTOON NETWORK IM TALKING CARTOON NETWORKS PLURAL)
			<br><h1>CHRISTMAS CAME EARLY THIS YEAR</h1>
			<br>https://www.newrafael.com/websites/ BOI LINKED ME THIS SIMPLY ENDLESS AMOUNT OF WEBSITES.
			THIS IS SO COOL. some of my favorites include...
			http://www.blankwindows.com/ hamster mentioned this would make a good template for an art gallery (she wants it for her site but im totally stealing it).
			ive been trying to come up with creative ways to display art online. i think i was still inhibited by the idea that user-friendliness > curiosity.
			<br>http://www.itwillneverbethesame.com/ this is just plain cool. the black+white thin outline sites from this guy are hashtag goals (i could be biased towards this style because it's like skutnik's style too fkjldsaf)
			<br>http://www.leduchamp.com/
			<br>http://www.biglongnow.com/
			<br>NICE AND SIMPLE. something i noticed about http://www.pleasetouchme.com/ is that it only worked when i put my hand up to my touchscreen.
			i couldnt get the figures to move using just my mouse, but it's weird because apparently this project comes from 2005. nobody had touchscreens back then...Wat
			<br>ALSO DUDE i looked at tis guys main page and apparently hes like a real ass artist HE'S IN ART GALLERIES AND EVERTYHING HUH
			<br>http://www.whitetrash.nl/ youre gonna go far kid
			<br><h1>IDK SOME CAT WITH BONGO</h1>
			<br>https://bongo.cat/
			<br><h1>SKUTNIk</h1>
			http://www.mateuszskutnik.com/games/ buy this beautiful bastards flash games. submachine in particular has long captured my heart
			</br><h1>retroactively speaking of content i cant find</h1>
			http://mediavisionds.com/cosmicblobs/index.html i would kill a man to get my hands on cosmic blobs.
			FKDLSAF IM TRYING TO LISTEN TO SOMEONES RAVE MUSIC PLAYLIST AND THIS SITE IS PRODUCING RANDOM SOUND EFFECTS.
			I SWEAR EVERY EARLY 2000S WEBSITE AND FLASH GAME USED THAT SAME POP SOUND EFFECT. somehow im not nostalgic for <i>that</i> in the slightest
			</br><h1>I MISS GAINAX</h1>
			https://web.archive.org/web/20000511000150if_/http://www.gainax.co.jp:80/menu-e.html
			what i really want you to click is that banner on the top that says FLCL (for some reason i cant link to it directly...maybe its php idk).
			its a really cool fooly cooly directory that has information that's hard to find even today. besides that, the old gainax site is just
			Effing Precious. i love how websites used to crowd all this cluster to the left with no margin at all KJLFA
			IT'S LIKE CLEARLY YOU GUYS HAVE A LOT OF CONTENT YOU WANT TO SHOW BUT YOU'RE NOT EVEN USING 50% OF THE PAGE... SIMPLY CLASSIC.
			speaking of gainax i found this through some means https://web.archive.org/web/20050404155800/http://www.gainax.co.jp:80/anime/awaawa/index-e.html
			i love ebichu and i really want to watch the other cartoons from this collection but i cant find them!!! if anyone can find them email me from my about page.
			or just spicyyeti0@gmail.com there you go
			</br><h1>its too bad whoever designed this website sacrificed their life for cult activity</h1>
			https://web.archive.org/web/19990225145633/http://www.highersource.com:80/
			at least they're riding that spaceship to heaven now
			oh yeah and i found out from the h3 podcast that these cult guys also designed this random madonna website
			https://web.archive.org/web/19970707224631/http://www.pre-madonna.com:80/
			its much uglier than the actual cult site in my opinion JKLFDS BUT that oldschool look is always kind of cool in its own way
			<br><h1><a href="https://crouton.net/">crouton???</a></h1>
			thanks boi
			</br><h1>OKAY WTF I WAS LOOKING FOR A TOM AND JERRY SOUND CLIP TO MAKE A MEME AND I FOUND THIS</h1>
			</br>http://www.tomandjerryonline.com/?utm_source=tnj&utm_medium=topnavrib&utm_campaign=logo
			AKSJLFDJAKL I WAS LIKE IN SHOCK WHEN I FOUND THIS. it actually does have a page with soundclips amongst many Many other things.
			theres also like deep lore??? the first post is currently a heartfelt message about how this website's popularity has declined since its
			inception 20 YEARS AGO. WHAT??? THE HISTORICAL VALUE IS REAL. theres another post somewhere about whether the violence in
			tom and jerry influences kids to commit real acts of violence like it starts considering factors like exposure to drug use and abuse
			and LKJFDSAJFDLSA THIS IS A TOM AND JERRY FAN SITE WHAT IS GOING ON.......................i also notice that when you click to a new page
			a picture of tom chasing jerry shows up for like .000001 seconds and im so curious about it. is it just the background image?? is it a
			separate element pushed to the bottom of the page and it only shows once the content is reloading? was it a purposeful design choice made
			20 years ago when websites took more time to load?????????????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I..............I JUST.............
			<h1>ME: *FLIPS THE SCRIPT*</h1>
			</br>scrolling down to see new content is really annoying so starting here i'll post content from newest to oldest. of course by the time you reach this post
			you'll have already experienced this change.
			</br><h1></h1>
			</br><h1>COMING UP NEXT: THE FIRST POST I ACTUALLY MADE HERE FROM WHEN I WAS STILL UPDATING THE PAGE OLDEST TO NEWEST</h1>
			</br><h1> anyhow </h1>
			i figured id start making random pages to populate my website.
			when i'm dead at least you'll all know how much i liked all sorts of whositwhatsits.
			thinking about that makes me sad though because when i'm dead a bunch of these websites
			won't exist anymore :( i mean DAMN its only 2018 and flash sites are already being slam dunked
			straight into the ethereal realm. you know what would be a great job? INTERNET HISTORIAN.
			i know that one dude has a youtube under that alias but i feel like there being only one
			internet historian isn't quite cutting it.
			</br><h1> /br h1 </h1>
			the first page im pulling from my holy bookmarks is...
			http://susumuhirasawa.com/
			im holding onto google translate for dear life but that is entirely unecessary as
			reading japanese is not a prerequisite to gazing upon beautiful web design.
			HOVER OVER THAT MENU BAR I MEAN WHAT IS THAT ANIMATION I LOVE IT. susumu's aesthetic
			gives me tong nou vibes. this site feels like the future we deserved to live in.
			instead we're living in a god Damned world where websites don't have any containers.
			what? youre too good for compressed content? YOU THINK YOU HAVE ENOUGH SHIT TO FILL ALL THAT
			SPACE?!!?!? BE HUMBLE. oh hey there was an english button on the website this whole time.
			so anywyas this guy's my favorite musician. look at these silly motherfuckers.
			<img src="../img/coolthings1.PNG">
			actually just watch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uFMJVuzW53w&ab_channel=vistoron">this</a>
			it's my favorite thing ever. that's a phrase you're going to have to get used to me saying and
			YES i mean it every time.
			</br><h1>time for this next thing</h1>
			http://www.akikoyano.com/english/
			i reminded myself of this other musician's site. idk i like the big cat on the front page
			i'm not even going to click the other links. sometimes all a website really needs are some
			Very Big Pictures.
			</br><h1> hi</h1>
			i had some pucca notebooks i acquired in italy when i was probably like 3. only this year
			did i notice they had this link on them... http://puccaclub.com/
			<img src="../img/coolthings_puccapads.PNG">
			FKJDASLF WHAT DID I FIND. PUCCA IS REALLY GREAT THOUGH SO KEEPING THE PUCCA HYPE ALIVE
			AFTER ALL THESE YEARS IS FINE BY ME!!! i wonder if the same people made aggretsuko
			yeah im going to continue wondering that and not looking it up.
			</br><h1>breaking heads</h1>
			...with these wonderful websites. stickers showed me this one http://blackpeopleloveus.com/
			always nice to revisit the good old days

			custom cursors TODAYS YOUTH ARE RUINING EVERYTHING THEY DON'T EVEN <i>HAVE</i> CURSORS.
			</br><h1>is html a language written by the devil</h1>
			next up here's something Sir Tay showed me. http://www.standingonthecorner.com/#open
			i havent heard the band this belongs to but i highly appreciate their disjointed web style.
			non descriptive links that lead you down a journey that just might never end.
			and this is the internet, so the journey actually definitely will not end, ever!
			it's so beautiful it inspires me to make my website make even less sense.
			</br><h1>wurtz</h1>
			http://www.billwurtz.com/ it's not like anyone needs my stinking link to know who THE bill wurtz is.
			props to the man; his site is why im dedicating myself to this random bullshit as we speak.
			</br><h1>speaking of such things</h1>
			https://www.handprint.com/index.html this has to be one of the most extensive art resources on the internet.
			and it doesnt even stop there. i haven't fully excavated this site yet. honestly i couldnt even
			get through the perspective pages https://www.handprint.com/HP/WCL/tech10.html because of how detailed
			and complex this shit is. the perspective section has 5 gigantic walls of text; the perspective section
			is one of 17 links from the technique section. the technique section is one of 12 links from the
			watercolors section. and the watercolors section is one of 8 links from the home page. WHAT!!!!!!!!!!!!
			i was Tickled to discover that this website is cited in james gurney's 'color and light'.
